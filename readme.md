The idea of Sherpa is to provide a check list of tasks, for players within World of Warcraft to make sure they check off as they level their characters through the new content of the game.

The user will sign up to the service, adding them to a users table and present them with, the list of tasks to be completed, allowing them to mark them as completed as the achieve each task.

The id for each step is inserted into an array associated with that specfic user so that any step that has previouly been completed will not be printed.

There are no installtion requirments to access and use Sherpa
